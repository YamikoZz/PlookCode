"""Generate varied conversational SFT pairs (greetings, small talk, identity, help-routing).

The model answered greetings poorly: the only chat data was ~300 `intro` examples that all
map every greeting to the SAME long bio, so the model never learned short, natural replies
or small talk. A 20M model CAN learn these low-entropy turns if shown enough examples.

IMPORTANT — dedup is on the QUESTION only (instruction.py normalizes casefold+whitespace and
keeps the first answer per question). So mapping one greeting to many answers is pointless:
only the first survives. Instead we emit MANY DISTINCT question strings (realistic phrasings),
each paired with one rotated answer, so variety comes from distinct questions, not duplicates.

Identity facts are kept consistent with the existing `intro` data: PlookCode is a small
model trained from scratch on a home PC, best at short Python/JavaScript, English first.
